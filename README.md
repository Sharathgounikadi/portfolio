## Portfolio Page

The portfolio page is designed to showcase projects, skills, and contact information in a visually appealing manner. Below are detailed notes and instructions for managing and updating the portfolio page.

### Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the main source code for the application.
  - **`components/`**: Houses reusable React components for different sections of the portfolio.
  - **`styles/`**: Contains CSS or Tailwind CSS files for styling the portfolio.
  - **`assets/`**: Stores images, icons, and other static assets used in the portfolio.
  - **`pages/`**: Contains the main pages of the portfolio, such as Home, Projects, About, and Contact.

### Components

- **`Header/`**: Displays the navigation bar and possibly a logo.
- **`Hero/`**: The introductory section of the portfolio with a prominent headline and introductory text.
- **`Projects/`**: Showcases various projects with descriptions and links to more details.
- **`Skills/`**: Lists skills and technologies with corresponding logos.
- **`Contact/`**: Contains contact information and possibly a contact form.
- **`About/`**: Provides background information and personal details.

### Styling

- **CSS**: The portfolio uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly set up in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
- **Custom CSS**: Additional styles are defined in the `styles/` directory or directly within components if needed.

### Responsiveness

- **Media Queries**: The portfolio is designed to be responsive across various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobiles). Media queries are included to adjust layout and styling based on screen size.

### Animations and Effects

- **Animations**: Smooth animations are applied to enhance user experience. Key animations include fade-ins for text and hover effects for images and buttons.
- **Effects**: Subtle graphic effects like scaling and color transitions are used for interactive elements.

### Development

- **Running the Project**: Use `npm start` to launch the development server and view live changes.
- **Building for Production**: Run `npm run build` to create a production-ready build of the portfolio. This will generate optimized static files for deployment.

### Testing

- **Manual Testing**: Review the portfolio in different browsers and devices to ensure proper functionality and responsiveness.
- **Automated Testing**: If automated tests are set up, use `npm test` to run them and confirm everything works as expected.

### Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**: If you encounter issues with responsiveness or styling, check media queries and CSS rules. Ensure that Tailwind CSS classes are applied correctly.
- **Documentation**: For more details on Tailwind CSS or React, refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) and [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

### Contributing

- **Updates**: To update the portfolio, modify the relevant components and styles as needed. Follow best practices for code formatting and testing.
- **Feedback**: If you have suggestions for improvements or encounter issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
